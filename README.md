# Object-Detection-using-Alexnet
This code builds and summarizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Keras with TensorFlow
backend. The initial architecture taken was AlexNet which has 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected
layers. Different experiments were performed with different Architectures of CNN taking AlexNet as the based
architecture.

The dataset used is the CIFAR 10 Dataset
CNN backbone used in AlexNet

Please follow the given document for more details on the different epochs, optimisers followed in the project
